										<h1>Freight Management System/Application</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/freight-management-system.png" alt="Freight Management System" /></span>
									<p>One of my first major project when I was innitially contracted under OTP Design-works was to continue
									the development of a pre-existing freight management application hosted under Zoho Creator.
									This app utilized Zoho CRM and Books for contact management, and an external freight/trucking management app for additional features not present in Creator.
									I had created views, functions and features that used FM's (Fluid mobility) API to return crucial data on truck's current location, routing, and status.
									I was resposible as well for fixing issues present within the apps contact management. This was less a fault of previous work done on the app and more to do with Zoho's Internal Integration.</p>

										<h1>Point of Sales System</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Store-POS.svg" alt="Point of Sales System" /></span>
									<p>I was resposible for new implementations, improvements, and fixes regarding a Point of Sales system used by Eco Paints & Coating Supplys. A paint store located in Hamilton, Ontario
									I created custom HTML/CSS views due to Zoho Creators typically scrubbing any CSS based template languages (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc), Creator report views with custom sorts and forms
									that communicate with integrated applications such as:
									<ol>
										<li>Zoho Books</li>
										<li>Zoho CRM</li>
										<li>Zoho Desk</li>
										<li>Google Calendar</li>
										<li>Mapbox</li>
										<li>And much more</li>
									</ol></p>

										<h1>Internal Payment Processor</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/payment-processor.png" alt="Payment Processor" /></span>
									<p>Similar to payment processors like Intelli Pay. Our Payment processor was made to give competitive rates on transactions between our business partners.
									I was responsible for integrating a new payment option under an existing integration, as well as general debugging/fixes, front-end and back-end.
									We allowed for saved payment details using tokenizations and additional security measures. The processor used a combination of Zoho Creator, Books, and PHP hosted on Linux.</p>

									<p>I was referenced by a friend for a steps public art program. They were looking for a banner design to string up for Pride Month, and since they were expecting something "Summer themed"
									this is what I came up with. The project had It's complication, mainly with my abilitys to translate my art into digital media. I do have prior experience using photo editing and drawing software,
									but I struggled to find a program on Ubuntu, and Wine emulated programs don't support pressure sensativity. I ended up completing the design/final work on Krita, and the banner design was installed in various locations.
